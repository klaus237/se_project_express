# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This is the back-end server for the WTWR (What to Wear?) application â€” a service that helps users decide what to wear based on the weather.

## ðŸ§° Project Description

The project consists of building a RESTful API using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**, with full support for user authentication, CRUD operations, and secure access to resources.

The main features of this back-end server include:

- User registration and authentication (JWT-based)
- CRUD operations on clothing items
- Ability to like/unlike clothing items
- Public access to the clothing catalog
- Protected routes requiring user authentication
- Secure password hashing using bcrypt
- Input validation and proper error handling

## ðŸš€ Technologies and Techniques Used

- **Node.js** â€” runtime environment
- **Express.js** â€” web framework for routing and middleware
- **MongoDB + Mongoose** â€” database and ODM
- **bcryptjs** â€” secure password hashing
- **jsonwebtoken (JWT)** â€” for authentication and protected routes
- **Celebrate/Joi** â€” request validation
- **CORS** â€” to allow cross-origin requests
- **ESLint** â€” code linting for code quality
- **REST principles** â€” for structuring the API
- **Environment Variables** â€” to manage secrets securely
- **Error handling middleware** â€” centralized error management
